1 . Run the gui.py without debugging otherwise may result as error (in vscode use Ctrl + F5 ) to run without debugging.         
2 . **Task2.ipynb** that contain model generation and training .      
3 . The report file is also attached **Task2_report**.      
4. The demonstration vedio **Task2_vedio** is also uploaded to showcase the procedure .
